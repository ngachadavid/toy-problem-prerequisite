It has 3 project files under one repo, Student Grade Generator, Speed detector and Net Salary Calculator.

Purpose of the projects;
# Student Grade Generator
The program shows the grade according to the marks input. The marks input ranges from 0 and 100. The output should display the grades such as;
A>79, B- 60 to 79, C- 59 to 49, D- 40 to 49, E- less 40.

# Speed Detector
The program takes the speed of the car as input for example 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

# Net Salary Calculator
Here the program's major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

There is addition of various links in accordance to KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the following links;
a) https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm
b) www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye

Therefore the program calculates the total_deductions that is the nhif + paye + nssf and deduct the amount from the gross pay to get to the net salary.
